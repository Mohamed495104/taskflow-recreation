## 🎤 Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Version:
> "I built TaskFlow Recreation, a full-stack task manager with an AI recreation zone. It uses React 19, GraphQL, MongoDB, and deploys serverlessly on Vercel. The standout feature is an unbeatable TicTacToe AI using the minimax algorithm."

### 60-Second Version:
> "TaskFlow Recreation is a MERN application that combines task management with workplace wellness. I implemented a hybrid database strategy—MongoDB for complex task queries and Firestore for real-time stats. The recreation zone features an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm, making it unbeatable in hard mode. The backend is optimized for serverless deployment with connection pooling, reducing cold-start times by 80%. It demonstrates both practical full-stack skills and computer science fundamentals."

### 2-Minute Version:
> "I created TaskFlow Recreation to solve two problems: efficient task management and workplace wellness. Built with React 19 and Node.js, it features a complete task CRUD system with GraphQL and MongoDB, plus an innovative recreation zone with AI-powered games.
>
> The technical highlight is the TicTacToe AI. I implemented the minimax algorithm with three difficulty levels. In hard mode, it's mathematically unbeatable because it recursively evaluates all possible game states to find the optimal move.
>
> For the architecture, I made strategic decisions. I used a hybrid database approach—MongoDB for task data where I need complex queries, and Firestore for user stats where I need real-time updates. The backend is serverless on Vercel with connection pooling to minimize cold-start latency.
>
> I've also done a comprehensive analysis identifying security improvements needed, like adding Firestore rules and rate limiting. The project is live and deployed, demonstrating both development skills and production awareness."
